 * The Alchemy upgrade drinks and eats on a condition. Its item definitions do that in lambdas, so the
 * hooks sit in the two named methods around them instead: the condition check in {@code applyTo} that
 * starts it, and, on 1.21.1, the one call in {@code tick} that finishes whatever is being applied.
 *
 * <p>Core for 1.21.1 finishes through {@code Item.finishUsingItem}, past the mod's hook, like the
 * Feeding upgrade does, so thirst has to be handed out here. From 1.21.11 it finishes through
 * {@code ItemStack.finishUsingItem}, where the mod's own hook already does it, and doing it here as well
 * counted every potion twice.
