/**
 * The exchange itself: two files in one directory, one line of JSON each way.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code in.jsonl} — the agent appends a request per line and never reads it back.</li>
 *   <li>{@code out.jsonl} — this appends a reply per line and never reads it back.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A file queue rather than a socket: there is no port to allocate and no firewall prompt, it works
 * between a game the build launched and an agent that has only file tools, and the whole exchange is
 * still on disk to read afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Reading tracks a byte offset rather than a line count, and stops at the last newline. A request
 * the agent is still half way through writing is therefore left alone until the next poll instead of
 * being parsed as truncated JSON. Nothing here assumes the writer locks the file, because on Windows
 * it does not.
 *
 * <p>One game owns a directory at a time, through an operating system lock on {@code queue.lock} held
 * for as long as the process lives. Two games on one directory each rotate the other's files away
 * and append to the same {@code out.jsonl}, so both runs' answers are worthless; a game left running
 * after its Gradle task was killed is the usual way to get there. The system drops the lock when the
 * process ends, however it ends, so a killed game never leaves a stale one behind the way a pid in a
 * file would.
