/**
 * Turns the lines an {@link AgentQueue} hands over into answers, one game tick at a time.
 *
 * <p>Everything runs on the game thread, in {@link #tick}: a probe that read the player, the HUD or
 * the framebuffer from another thread would read a half-updated one. Polling is a file size check
 * every {@link #POLL_TICKS} ticks, which is cheap enough to leave on for every development run.
 *
 * <p>Requests are answered <em>in order, one at a time</em>. A handler that takes a deferral - holding
 * a key for thirty ticks, waiting for a capture to reach disk - stops the next request being started
 * until it has answered. Without that a script is a batch rather than a sequence: every line of it
 * runs in the tick the poll read it, so "hold sprint at 7, set 6, hold sprint again" sends both
 * {@code /thirst set} commands in the same tick and starts both holds together, and the two answers
 * come out identical and meaningless. The cost is one request per deferral rather than many at once,
 * which at one command a second is nothing.
 *
 * <p>This class knows nothing of Minecraft, of a mod loader or of the mod. It is the half that would
 * survive being lifted into another project, and {@code checkAgentCore} fails the build when a class
 * in this package starts importing one of them.
