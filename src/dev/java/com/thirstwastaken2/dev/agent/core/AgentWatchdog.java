/**
 * Ends an unattended run whose game thread has stopped ticking: a deadlock, a native dialog, a loop
 * that never returns. The dispatcher's own stall check runs on that thread, so it cannot see this; a
 * frozen game otherwise sits with its window open and its Gradle task running until someone kills it.
 *
 * <p>A daemon thread that looks at {@link AgentDispatcher#lastTickNanos} every few seconds. When the
 * game has not ticked for the limit, it logs where the game thread is stuck, writes one line saying so
 * to {@code out.jsonl}, logs the {@code DONE} line an unattended run always ends with, and halts the
 * process. Halts rather than exits: a frozen game thread may hold the locks that shutdown hooks need,
 * and an exit that waits on them is the same hang again.
