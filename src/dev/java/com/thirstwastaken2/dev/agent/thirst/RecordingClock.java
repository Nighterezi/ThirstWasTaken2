/**
 * The game's clock while a recording runs: {@code Util.getNanos}, and {@code Util.getMillis} through
 * it, stand still between frames and step on by exactly the time one frame shows for in the GIF.
 *
 * <p>A recording takes a hundred milliseconds or more of real time a frame, and plays each back in
 * fifty. Whatever reads the clock rather than counting ticks, the config preview's rising and falling
 * droplets, a tooltip's fade, a text field's caret, then ran three times too fast in the result. On this
 * clock the game sees fifty milliseconds pass a frame, and its ticks follow from it as they do from
 * the real one, so everything plays at the speed it has in game.
 *
 * <p>{@code Util.timeSource} is the field vanilla keeps for exactly this, swapping the clock in tests;
 * it is not final on any supported version, so it is set by reflection rather than by a mixin on a
 * class loaded before any mod. When the recording stops, the real clock comes back less the time the
 * recording spent frozen, so the clock never jumps: a jump forward would have the game run a burst of
 * ticks to catch up. The frame limiter and the agent's own stall checks read {@code System.nanoTime},
 * which is left alone.
