/**
 * What a client that is being driven rather than played does with its window, the mouse pointer and
 * the screens between it and a world.
 *
 * <p>A driven client is one an agent sends requests to while the person who launched it is doing
 * something else on the same desktop. Three things about a played client get in the way of that, and
 * all are turned around by {@code -Pdriven}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The pointer.</b> Minecraft takes the cursor as soon as the window is focused with a world
 *       open, and holds it inside the frame until a screen opens. Clicking the window to glance at
 *       the bar then costs the pointer everywhere else on the desktop. A driven client needs none of
 *       it: every key the agent holds goes through the game's own key state and every command goes
 *       through the player's connection, so nothing here is ever steered by a physical mouse.
 *       {@code MouseGrabMixin} refuses the grab outright rather than releasing it a tick later, so
 *       the cursor is never hidden and never warped to the middle of the window.</li>
 *   <li><b>The window size.</b> The run tasks open a small window, which is right for two clients
 *       side by side and wrong for reading a HUD. A driven one is maximised instead. Maximised, not
 *       full screen: exclusive full screen takes the whole display and is exactly what a person
 *       working beside it does not want.</li>
 *   <li><b>Vanilla's experimental settings prompt.</b> "Worlds using Experimental Settings are not
 *       supported" stands between {@code -Pquickplay} and the world whenever a mod on the classpath
 *       turns a feature flag on, which the Supplementaries and Moonlight Lib clients do. A driven
 *       client presses "I know what I'm doing!" for itself; a played one still gets to read it. This
 *       is the loader independent sibling of NeoForge's {@code LoadingWarnings}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is off by default because it is the opposite of what a manual pass needs: without the grab
 * there is no mouse look and no click reaching the world, so a person, or computer use standing in
 * for one, cannot play the client at all. An unattended run turns it on by itself, since
 * {@code -Pagent=<file>} means nobody is at the keyboard.
