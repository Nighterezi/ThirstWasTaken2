/**
 * The agent's virtual mouse pointer: a position in GUI pixels the game is told the mouse is at, so a
 * screen draws hover states and tooltips under it exactly as it would under a real mouse.
 *
 * <p>It exists for recordings. {@code client.click} alone presses a control without the mouse ever
 * being over it, which is the right thing for a check and looks like nothing happened in a video. Once
 * {@code client.mouse} has shown the pointer, clicks and scrolls with no point of their own land where
 * it is, and {@link Recorder} writes its position beside every frame so {@code tools/agent/make_gif.py}
 * can draw a cursor there: the framebuffer never holds one, since the system draws the real cursor.
 *
 * <p>While it is shown the real mouse is ignored ({@code MouseMoveMixin}), and the position is written
 * again every tick, because opening a screen may centre the game's idea of the mouse.
