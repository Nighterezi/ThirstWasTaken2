/**
 * The keys the agent may hold down, by short name.
 *
 * <p>Input goes through the game's own key state, never through the operating system. That is what
 * removes the footnote the manual-testing skill carries: a modifier sent as a real key event is
 * released again before the server ever sees the player crouch, whereas a key the game believes is
 * down stays down for as many ticks as it is asked to.
 *
 * <p>Only the keys every supported version has are listed. Vanilla has added and removed others around
 * them, and a name that resolves on one version and not on another would make a script version
 * specific for no gain.
 *
 * <p>Two of them are not simply held. Vanilla's own Sneak and Sprint accessibility settings turn those
 * keys into toggles, and a toggled key that the agent presses for thirty ticks crouches the player and
 * leaves them crouching, rather than crouching them for thirty ticks. The dev clients in this
 * repository have {@code toggleCrouch:true} in their options, so that is what a script gets unless it
 * changes it. {@code client.info} answers both settings for exactly this reason: read them before
 * holding sneak or sprint, and read the state back afterwards rather than assuming.
