# Contributing to ThirstWasTaken2

Thanks for helping out. Bug reports, translations, ideas and code are all welcome.

## Reporting a bug

Open an [issue](https://github.com/Nighterezi/ThirstWasTaken2/issues/new/choose) with the bug report
form. The most useful details are:

- the full jar name, for example `ThirstWasTaken2-1.0.7+26.2.jar`, which gives both the mod and the
  Minecraft version;
- Fabric or NeoForge, and the other mods installed;
- the steps that cause the problem, and the log or crash report if there is one.

Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) first, in case the behaviour is an intended change.

## Suggesting a feature

Use the feature request form on the same page, or ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YwD9Xv7Beu).
For anything large, open an issue before starting work, so we can agree on the approach first.

## Translations

Language files are in `src/main/resources/assets/thirstwastaken2/lang/`. To fix a translation, edit
that language's file. To add a language, copy `en_us.json`, rename it to the game's locale code (for
example `de_de.json`), and translate the values only. Keep the keys and any `%s` placeholders as they
are.

## Code

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Follow [Build](README.md#build) in the README to build and test the mod.
3. Before changing code, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the `AGENTS.md` in the folder you are
   working in. They list the rules the build checks and where each part of the mod lives.
4. Run the in-game tests for at least one Fabric and one NeoForge version:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew ":26.2.x:runGametest" ":26.2.x-neoforge:runGametest"
   ```

5. Open a pull request that explains what changed and why. CI builds and tests every version.

A few rules that apply to most changes:

- The mod must build on every supported Minecraft version and on both loaders.
- Other mods stay optional. Never add a required dependency.
- Anything a player can see needs a line in `en_us.json`.
- Player-facing changes get a line under `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
